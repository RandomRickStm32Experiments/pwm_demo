## How to load into STM32CubeIDE
1. From this github page, go to the green Code box and select Download ZIP
2. Unzip the directory to wherever you wish, which can also be in an existing IDE workspace.
3. If the directory is not called "pwm_demo", e.g. it's been renamed "pwm_demo - master", rename it to "pwm_demo"
4. From STM32CubeIDE, select File -> Import. This pops up an Import dialog box.
5. In the Import dialog box, click General -> Existing Projects into workspace
6. click "next"
7. Browse to the location you unzipped the code (don't go into pwm_demo, go to the parent folder containing it)
8. In the Projects box, make sure that pwm_demo is checked
9. click "Finish"

You are now ready to edit or compile the project.
